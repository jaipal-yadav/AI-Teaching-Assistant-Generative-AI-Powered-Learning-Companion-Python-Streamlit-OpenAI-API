        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized into two main types:\n\n1. **Narrow AI**: Also known as weak AI, it is designed to perform a specific task or a narrow range of tasks. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems, and computer vision applications.\n\n2. **General AI**: Also known as strong AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), this type represents a hypothetical AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a broad range of tasks, similar to a human. As of my last update in October 2023, general AI has not yet been realized.\n\nAI technologies often utilize various methods such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics to perform tasks autonomously or assist humans in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment."
